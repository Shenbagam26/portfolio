        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="para1">
           In Race Against Time, Heatblast had less fire on his head and most of his head was exposed. His stone skin gained cracks of yellow glow and his plates were further apart, exposing almost parts of his plasma body. The Omnitrix symbol appeared to be embedded in his chest.
    
           In Ultimate Alien, Heatblast closely resembled Alan Albright, only taller, not as skinny, slightly altered and his face shape was more similar to the Original Series. His eyes were no longer connected to the fire on his head. The rocks over his body changed, with a burnt black color and red markings on every edge of his rocky skin, resembling charcoal and his plasma body is a lighter shade of yellow.
